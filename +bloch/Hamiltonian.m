% This class defines system's hamiltonian using symbolic variables. If numerical values are necessary, one 
% can always use function subs(obj.***,symbolic variables,numerical values) and store the result 
% in a new user-defined variable. To find symbolic variables that are being used, use symvar(obj.***).

% The stored public properties are:
%
% -> hamiltonian - containes the system's basic hamiltonian. If the hamiltonian is transformed
% using a unitary transformation, it will be stored in a different variable. This one always
% contains the original hamiltonian
%
% -> transformed - containes the hamiltonian after a unitary transformation is applied. For
% basic couplings between states (*exp(iwt)), it doesn't contain their time dependence.
%
% -> transMatrix - unitary transformation matrix used
%
% -> energies - diagonal elements of hamiltonian (energies of all the states) stored as a vector
%
% -> couplings - a NxNx2 matrix (where N is number of states), where (i,j,2) element is Rabi rate associated
% with the i->j transition, and (i,j,1) is frequency of the light field
%
% -> detunings - Mx3 matrix, where M is number of defined detunings. (m,1) is the initial state index, (m,2) the final state index 
% and (m,3) is the detuning d
% 
% -> stateGraph - a directed graph of the system, where edges go along defined couplings (if coupling is defined as i->f,

%
% -> zeroEnergy - energy level (symbolic) defined as having 0 energy. Has to be a part of one of the energy levels specified in 'energies'.

%
% The class contains following public methods: 
%
% -> contructor Hamiltonian(n) - to create the object in this class, you have to call this function first. 
% The input is number of states (numerical value). The function creates empty matrices and stores them in appropriate variables.
%
% -> function addEnergies(v) - this function takes vector of energies (they should be symbolic) as its input and places them in the 
% hamiltonian. It also stores the vector in the property 'energies'.
%
% -> function addCoupling(S_i,S_f,W_r,w) - couples initial state S_i with final states S_f with a light field
% that has Rabi rate W_r and frequency w. It places appropriate term in the off-diagonal cells of the hamiltonian assuming
% rotating wave approximation (the term is -W_r/2*exp(iwt), without its c.c.; to obtain appropriate Rabi rates with appropriate signs and coefficients
% i.e. coupling strengths, substitute W_r with desired correct value). Variables S_i and S_f are numeric, while W_r and w have to be symbolic!
%
% -> function addPolyCoupling(S_i,S_f,W_r,w) - couples initial state S_i with final states S_f with a light field
% that has Rabi rate W_r and frequency w. This function should be used, if multiple couplings between states are created.
%
% -> function defineStateDetuning(S_i,S_f,d) - often it is easier to work with detunings than with light frequencies. 
% This function changes variables, by replacing light's frequency w coupling states S_i and S_f with detuning d.
% Variables S_i and S_f are numeric, while d has to be symbolic!
%
% -> function defineEnergyDetuning(E_i,E_f,d,w) - This function changes variables in a more straight-forward way.
% It replaces frequency w by energy difference minus detuning (w=E_f-E-i-d). All variables have to be symbolic.
%
% -> function unitaryTransformation('Method',{'general','equations'}) - The function finds the appropriate frame, where there would be no time dependence in the hamiltonian,
% by using one of two methods. The default one (called without any arguments) looks at coupling through light fields between a state and state
% that is defined as having zero energy. The sum of frequencies in these couplings is put into the unitary matrix and used to transform the Hamiltonian.
% Time dependence is usually eliminated (it is not always possible; it depends on the system) and substitutions from defined detunings are made.
% If the function is called with option ('Method','equation'), the unitary transformation is found by solving a system of linear equation. This method is usable
% if there are at most as many couplings as number states. It does not require a defined zero energy. The resulting hamiltonian is stored in property 'transformed' 
% and transformation matrix in 'transMatrix'.
%
% -> function createGraph(L) - uses the dissipator object to create a directed graph. Vertices are states labeled using their respective energies,
% while edges are either couplings between states or decay paths labeld by either Rabi rates or decay rates.
%
% -> function plotGraph() - plots obj.stateGraph of the system
%
% -> function addSidebands(center,order,depth,spacing) - adds 'order' number of sidebands around 'center' frequency. They are added using
% expansion to Bessel functions (so it is crucial that the 'order' is chosen correctly depending on 'depth'; for exact solution, use addPhaseModulation()).
% The modulation depth and spacing between sidebands are define in 'depth' and 'spacing' respectively. This function should be used only after the
% unitary transformation of the hamiltonian (so after unitaryTransformation() function is are called).
%
% -> function addPhaseModulation(center,depth,mod_freq) - adds phase modulation to the laser of 'center' frequency of depth 'depth' and
% modulation frequency 'mod_freq'. The modulating part goes from exp(iwt) to exp(iwt + iBsin(w_m*t)), where 'B' is modulation depth, and 'w_m' is
% modulation frequency.
%
% -> function changeBasis(vecs) - performs transformation of the hamiltonian to a different basis. As argument it takes 'n' (number of
% states) vectors of length "n" defining the new basis, combines them in transformation matrix U and performs operation of U'HU. Operation is
% performed on the transformed hamiltonian and result overwrites it.
%
% -> function findDarkStates(ground_states,excited_states) - takes slice of the transformed hamiltonian: H(ground_states,excited_states), which
% represents couplings between the ground and excited states. Both arguments should be lists of different indices and they don't have to
% cover the whole state space. The function then finds superpositions of ground states that are dark and bright with respect to transitions to
% listed excited state. By definition, dark states are the kernel of the obtained slice of the hamiltonian, while bright states are the image. 
% It stores the superpositions in 'bright states' and 'dark states' variables. 
%
% -> function adiabaticElimination(ground_states,excited_states) - takes slice of the transformed hamiltonian: H(ground_states,excited_states), which
% represents couplings between the ground and excited states. Both arguments should be lists of different indices and they don't have to
% cover the whole state space. If couplings between ground and excited states allow for creating of an effective hamiltonian without the excited
% states (for example in case of very large detunings), this eliminates them using a known procedure, which creates additional couplings between
% ground states. Remaining states (other than defined ground and excited states) are then concatenated to the result, which is then stored in 'obj.adiabaticHamiltonian'.
% Its size is smaller by the number of excited states.

% Private methods are described in the code.

% 1. Creates a 3x3 empty matrix [0 0 0] and saves it to "hamiltonian" property. Creates also 3x3x2 empty matrix and saves it to
%                               [0 0 0]
% to the "coupling" property. Finally, creates empty vector [0, 0, 0] and saves it to "energies".
%                            [wa 0 0]
% 2. The hamiltonian becomes [0 wb 0], "energies" is now a vector [wa,wb,we].
%                            [0 0 we]                                                             [wa                  0   Wae/2*exp(i*wae*t)]
% 3. Adds a coupling between states 1 and 3. Hamiltonian obtains offdiagonal elements and becomes [0                   wb         0          ]. 
%                              [0 0 [wae Wae]]                                                    [Wae/2*exp(-i*wae*t) 0          we         ]
% Property "couplings" becomes [0 0     0    ]
%                              [0 0     0    ]                 [wa                  0                   Wae/2*exp(i*wae*t) ]
% 4. Different coupling is added. Hamiltonian becomes equal to [0                   wb                  Wbe/2*exp(-i*wbe*t)].
%                              [0 0 [wae Wae]]                 [Wae/2*exp(-i*wae*t) Wbe/2*exp(-i*wbe*t)          we        ]                                                                
% Property "couplings" becomes [0 0 [wbe Wbe]]
%                              [0 0     0    ] 
% 5. The detuning between states 1 and 3 is defined: wae=we-wa-dae. The function performs variable substitution.
% 6. The detuning between states 2 and 3 is defined: wbe=we-wb-dbe.
% 7. Sets excited state energy we to be zero and saves that information to 'zeroEnergy' property.
% 8. Unitary transformation is performed. In the Bloch equations, in order to perserve the form of the equations after 
% the transformation, the hamiltonian has to be transformed using the formula: Hnew=T'HT - iT'dT/dt, where A' is hermitian 
% conjugate. In general, the unitary transforamtion is performed by a matrix of the following form:
% 
%    [exp(i*a1*t)       ...0]
% T= [          \           ]
%    [0...       exp(i*an*t)]
% 
% After the transformation Hnew(j,k)=H(j,k)*exp(i(ak-aj)*t)+delta(j,k)*aj. We can then eliminate the time dependence by appropriate
% choice of exponents ai. We obtain a set of linear equations of the form w_jk=aj-ak, if the number of couplings (so non-zero off-diagonal elements)
% is at most equal to the number of states, which can be solved for all ai (Method II). In our example
%                                   [exp(i*wae*t)     0         0]
% the transformation matrix becomes [     0      exp(i*wae*t)   0] and is saved to property "transMatrix". The hamiltonian becomes
%                                   [     0           0         1]
% 
%        [we-dae   0     Wae/2]
% H_new= [ 0     we-dbe  Wbe/2] and is saved into property "transformed". Because we also specified the zero energy, substitution we=0 is performed  in the end.
%        [Wae/2  Wbe/2     we ]
%
% Method I uses a more general method. Here, all the diagonal elements of the unitary matrix are found by looking at 'coupling path' between the
% (i,i) state and the state defined as having zero energy (or a state close to it), if it's specified (otherwise state 1 energy is used). In our
% example, this method will lead to transformation matrix identical to what we obtained using Method II.
